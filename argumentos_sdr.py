execute(args)
    Sediment Delivery Ratio.
    
    This function calculates the sediment export and retention of a landscape
    using the sediment delivery ratio model described in the InVEST user's
    guide.
    
    Args:
        args['workspace_dir'] (string): output directory for intermediate,
            temporary, and final files
        args['results_suffix'] (string): (optional) string to append to any
            output file names
        args['dem_path'] (string): path to a digital elevation raster
        args['erosivity_path'] (string): path to rainfall erosivity index
            raster
        args['erodibility_path'] (string): a path to soil erodibility raster
        args['lulc_path'] (string): path to land use/land cover raster
        args['watersheds_path'] (string): path to vector of the watersheds
        args['biophysical_table_path'] (string): path to CSV file with
            biophysical information of each land use classes.  contain the
            fields 'usle_c' and 'usle_p'
        args['threshold_flow_accumulation'] (number): number of upslope pixels
            on the dem to threshold to a stream.
        args['k_param'] (number): k calibration parameter
        args['sdr_max'] (number): max value the SDR
        args['ic_0_param'] (number): ic_0 calibration parameter
        args['drainage_path'] (string): (optional) path to drainage raster that
            is used to add additional drainage areas to the internally
            calculated stream layer
        args['l_max'] (number): the maximum allowed value of the slope length
            parameter (L) in the LS factor. If the calculated value of L
            exceeds 'l_max' it will be clamped to this value.
        args['n_workers'] (int): if present, indicates how many worker
            processes should be used in parallel processing. -1 indicates
            single process mode, 0 is single process but non-blocking mode,
            and >= 1 is number of processes.
    
    Returns:
        None.
